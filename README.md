Solution to the MiBosillo IT Challenge 

My approach to the given problem : 

The given problem can be considered as Dijkstra’s shortest path finding problem. 
BFS can be done to find if there would exist a path from one node to another or not. 
And also to find the distance from one node to another(shortest) Djikstra’s algorithm can be used. 
However, In the program various different functions to compute shortest path, number of paths and edges involved. 

Djikstra’s algorithm would find a shortest-path from a fixed start node. 
So the distances or edge weights can be represented as an adjacency matrix 
With a complexity of O(|V|^3).
